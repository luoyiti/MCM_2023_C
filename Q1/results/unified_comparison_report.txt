Unified Model Comparison Report: Ensemble vs Prophet vs Chronos
======================================================================

All models use the same evaluation criteria:
  - CV settings: min_train=180, n_splits=3, horizon=30
  - Confidence interval: 95% CI (converted to 90% for visualization)
  - Evaluation metrics: RMSE, Coverage, MASE, Pinball, Winkler

Summary
======================================================================

[Full History] Best Model:
  Best RMSE: Chronos (4114.8911)

[Recent 240 Days] Best Model:
  Best RMSE: Chronos (1785.6898)

Note: Model architecture differences prevent perfectly fair comparison
      - Ensemble: SARIMA-based with changepoint detection and log transform
      - Prophet: Automatic changepoint/seasonality, uses log transform
      - Chronos: Transformer architecture, no explicit feature engineering
